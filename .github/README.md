## What is this?  
A simple but adorable digital clock project where numbers are replaced with neko-chan (catgirl) images. Created "out of boredom," but someone might enjoy it!  

## How to Use  
Simply open `index.html` in your favorite web browser!

## About the Project  
NekoClock started as a personal project born from boredom and the desire to recreate something similar—but entirely on my own. While I'm not entirely sure about its practical purpose, I hope someone might find it charming enough to:  
- Port to Android/Windows/Linux as widgets  
- Use as a decorative element for browser homepages  
- The project is fully open-source, and you can replace the girls with other images!
